# os_project
to do:

1. - [ ] implement classes in game.py for cleaner code
2. - [x] handle input seperately for the two players
3. - [ ] pass ball position across the networks

## some notes about networking ##
we are going to implement a client-server model
simulation of the game is done on the server side
on the client side two things happen
1. taking input
2. rendering the game
